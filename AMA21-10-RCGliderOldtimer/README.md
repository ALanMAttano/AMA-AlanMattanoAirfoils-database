# Airfoil specific for a big RC old-timer glider that flies slow.

### Characteristic
* Low wing loading target
* Low Re numbers
* High max lift number
* Good efficieny

### Issues
* DAD is not capable of testing the same airfoil in multiple Re conditions.
* DAD not capable to extract one polar decreasing Re while increasing the Cl.
